          A mango is an edible stone fruit produced by the tropical tree
          Mangifera indica which is believed to have originated from the region
          between northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India. M.
          indica has been cultivated in South and Southeast Asia since ancient
          times resulting in two distinct types of modern mango cultivars: the
          "Indian type" and the "Southeast Asian type".
